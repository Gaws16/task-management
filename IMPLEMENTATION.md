# Project-Based Task Management Implementation

## Database Structure

1. **Projects Table**

   - id (UUID): Primary key
   - name: Project name
   - description: Project description
   - created_by: Reference to auth.users
   - created_at/updated_at: Timestamps

2. **Project Members Table**

   - id (UUID): Primary key
   - project_id: Reference to projects
   - user_id: Reference to auth.users
   - role: 'owner', 'admin', or 'member'
   - joined_at: Timestamp

3. **Tasks Table**
   - id (UUID): Primary key
   - title: Task title
   - description: Task description
   - status: 'todo', 'in_progress', 'testing', 'done'
   - project_id: Reference to projects
   - assignee_id: Reference to auth.users (nullable)
   - priority: 'low', 'medium', 'high'
   - created_by: Reference to auth.users (nullable)
   - created_at/updated_at: Timestamps

## Row Level Security (RLS)

1. **Projects RLS**

   - Users can view projects they created or are members of
   - Users can insert their own projects
   - Project owners and admins can update projects
   - Project owners can delete projects

2. **Project Members RLS**

   - Project members can view other members
   - Project owners and admins can invite, update, and remove members

3. **Tasks RLS**
   - Project members can view tasks
   - Project members can insert and update tasks
   - Project owners and admins can delete tasks

## Application Architecture

1. **Authentication**

   - Supabase Auth for user authentication
   - Email/password and Google OAuth support
   - AuthContext to manage auth state

2. **Projects Management**

   - ProjectContext to manage project state
   - ProjectsList component to display available projects
   - ProjectDetail component to view a single project
   - ProjectModal for creating/editing projects
   - InviteModal for inviting users to projects

3. **Tasks Management**

   - TaskContext to manage tasks state
   - Board component to display project tasks by status
   - Column component for each task status
   - TaskCard component to display individual tasks
   - TaskModal for creating/editing tasks

4. **Routing**
   - /login: Authentication page
   - /projects: Projects list
   - /projects/:projectId: Single project view
   - Protected routes requiring authentication

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication**

   - Email/password login
   - Google OAuth integration
   - Session persistence
   - Protected routes

2. **Projects Management**

   - Create, view, edit, and delete projects
   - Invite users to projects
   - Assign different roles (owner, admin, member)

3. **Tasks Management**

   - Create, view, edit, and delete tasks
   - Drag-and-drop interface for status changes
   - Task assignment to project members
   - Priority levels and descriptions

4. **User Experience**
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Smooth animations with Framer Motion
   - Dark theme for reduced eye strain
   - Intuitive navigation and interactions

## Security Features

1. Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access data they're authorized to see
2. Authentication with Supabase provides secure session management
3. Different permission levels within projects (owner, admin, member)
4. Error handling and validation throughout the application

## Future Enhancements

1. Task comments and activity logs
2. File attachments for tasks
3. Calendar view for due dates
4. Custom project roles and permissions
5. Email notifications for task assignments and updates
6. Performance metrics and reporting
